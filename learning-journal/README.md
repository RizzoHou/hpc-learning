## Tips for Effective Journaling

1. **Be Consistent**: Regular short entries are better than occasional long ones
2. **Be Honest**: Record failures and frustrations as well as successes
3. **Be Specific**: Include details like error messages, code changes, and results
4. **Be Reflective**: Think about why something worked or didn't work
5. **Be Visual**: Use diagrams, charts, and screenshots when helpful

## Privacy

This journal is for your personal use. It's not shared unless you choose to share it. You can be completely honest about your struggles and successes.

## Getting Started

1. Review the templates in each directory
2. Create your first entry in `progress/daily-log.md`
3. Set a weekly learning goal
4. Start with the fundamentals module and document your journey
