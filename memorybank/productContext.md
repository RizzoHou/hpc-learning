# Product Context

## Project Overview
This project aims to make High Performance Computing (HPC) learning more structured and accessible. HPC encompasses parallel computing, distributed systems, cluster management, and optimization techniques that are essential for scientific computing, data analysis, and large-scale simulations.

## Problems Being Solved
1. **Unstructured Learning Paths**: HPC concepts are often taught in fragmented ways across different courses and resources
2. **High Barrier to Entry**: Setting up HPC environments (clusters, MPI, OpenMP) can be complex and intimidating
3. **Lack of Practical Examples**: Many HPC resources focus on theory without providing hands-on, runnable code examples
4. **Tooling Complexity**: Navigating the HPC ecosystem (schedulers, profiling tools, parallel libraries) requires significant guidance

## User Experience Goals
- Provide a clear, progressive learning path from basic to advanced HPC concepts
- Offer hands-on examples that users can run and modify
- Simplify environment setup with containerized or reproducible configurations
- Create a reference architecture for common HPC patterns and best practices
- Build a community resource that grows with contributions and real-world use cases

## Target Audience
1. **Students and Researchers** new to HPC who need structured guidance
2. **Software Engineers** transitioning to high-performance applications
3. **Data Scientists** scaling their workflows to larger datasets and computations
4. **System Administrators** managing HPC clusters who want to understand user needs better

## Success Metrics
- Reduced time to first successful parallel program
- Increased confidence in using HPC tools and frameworks
- Community contributions and extensions to the learning materials
- Adoption in academic or training settings
